Revisions.Space

OVERVIEW
--------
Revisions.space (previously Revisionista) started of as a a revision tracker and calculator, with a module for manipulating sentences and paragraphs. It is currently a web app with a workspace that allows you to do rule based phraze completion and manipulate sentences based on tools in the common poetry/lyricist toolkit, like end rhyme. It also allows you to build a phraze from an established rythmic schema.
